The data was collected from WHO and United Nations website for year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for analysis of factors actually affecting the life expectancy.

# GOAL
To find the factors contributing to the lower value of Life Expectancy.

# Observations
1.) Given Life expectancy factors = 22 = ( Country, Year , Status, Life expectancy, Adult Mortality, infant deaths, Alcohol, percentage expenditure, Hepatitis B, Measles, BMI, under-five deaths, Polio, Total expenditure, Diphtheria, HIV/AIDS, GDP, Population, thinness 1-19 years, thinness 5-9 years, Income composition of resource, Schooling)

2.) Columns with missing values: Life expectancy(10), Adult Mortality(10), Alcohol Intake(194), HepB Vaccination %(553), BMI(34), Pol3 Vaccination %(19), Total expenditure(226), Diphtheria Vaccination %(19), GDP(448), Population(652), thinness 10-19 years(34), thinness 5-9 years(34), Income composition of resources(167), Schooling(163)

3.) Factors Contributing to lower value of Life Expectancy are Adult Mortality, Infant Deaths, Under Five Deaths, thinness 1-19 years, thinness 5-9 years, Alcohol Intake, Measles
